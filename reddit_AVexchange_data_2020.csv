Happy New Years Eve all. I’ll be listing quite a few items in the next day or so, but to kick it off I’ve got an excellent pair of utopia headphones. I love these headphones, but I’ve settled my system around an abyss TC and find I can’t justify keeping both.

Conservatively I would rate 9/10, cups are perfect and only cosmetic blemish is a very slight of crinkling on one side of the headband (very common with utopias). It doesn’t effect the functionality of the headband at all, which still is firm (it’s really a cosmetic issue; see the fourth photo which has it, while the fifth photo, which is the other side of the headband, is perfect). The cups have no obvious cosmetic issue. I just installed new pads on them in a covid friendly gesture (I had planned to keep the original set which is still 9/10, but happy to include for extra if someone wants both). The utopia have around two years left on the warranty, I will provide the original invoice to the buyer. I’m the second owner and the first owner sold them to me only a few months after buying, and said he put around 10 hours on them. I’ve maybe added 30-40 hours, so on the whole pretty minimal use. Anyone who buys from me knows I take exceptional care of my gear.

They will include the original leather box and outer focal mailing box. However, I do NOT have the original focal cable (long story), but to compensate I’m including two excellent upgrade cables: 1) a five foot corpse cable, 1/4 termination, and 2) a 4 foot dyson cable with 4.4 termination, excellent ergonomics and great for DAPs. In addition, I’m including the official focal carrying case which wasn’t included with these stock but is much better for storage.

I’m asking 1999 net to me (seemed fitting on New Years Eve for Prince fans). Happy to accept reasonable offers but I think the price is fair given what I’m including. I’ve done a lot of deals here and am also very established on head fi (100+ perfect transactions) and eBay (similar feedback). Happy to answer any questions and thanks for looking!",11,0,{}

**Tin P1 -** These were my daily drivers for about a year, very detailed, comfortable, and enjoyable once you give them a little nudge in the bass. The right connector of the cable is starting to go bad, as sometimes it doesn't always make a full connection and they will sound left balanced, but it can be fixed by simply reseating them in your ears a couple of times. One of each foam tip is missing, although I would recommend using your own tips for them, as some of these tips were used quite frequently. **$80 shipped**

**Shuoer Tape -** These were my go to iems for travel, as they didn't require as much power, and had a good bit more bass than the p1s. These received much less use than the p1s, and most of the tips are either unused or close to it. **$75 shipped**

**SMSL IQ -** This is a really good little dac/amp, really underrated. I used this with the tapes when I traveled, and it sounded quite good, and was rather portable. The micro usb to usb type c cable is missing, but besides that, everything is there. **$90 shipped**

Hello, [u/AVexchange](https://www.reddit.com/u/AVexchange/)! Here is the list of items for sale.

**Focal Elegia**

I bought them here about two month ago from the first owner then purchased **Dekoni Elite** pads and **7N OCC single crystal copper balanced cables (2.5 mm TRRS)** separately. The headphones are in a perfect condition and I have been using other headphones more often than these ones.

Asking for **$430 Shipped** including the all the original accessories and packages, pads, and the balanced cables.

**Burson Soloist SL Mk2**

A  solid performer, Class A discrete amp. I upgraded from Drop THX 789 to  this amp and did not regret at all. I am selling it because of another  DAC/amp I recently purchased.

Asking for **$310 Shipped** including the original accessories and package.

**Chord Mojo**

I  am the second owner but it comes with a mint condition. It stayed at  home for the most of time since the first owner used it. I enjoy using  it a lot but soon realize that this DAC/amp is more meant for  portability (I know some people use it as a desktop DAC). I understand  why people like Chord products after using Mojo.

Asking for **$310 Shipped** including the original package.

**Audioquest Cinnamon USB A to B 1.5m cable**

I bought it as a bundle from another user. I decide to keep another cable and let this one go. It is a perfect condition.

Asking for **$85 Shipped**.

Selling some of my headphones and an amp to fund some new purchases. Please see descriptions below for each item. Price includes paypal fees but you have to cover shipping. 

Focal Stellia - $1850 - [Timestamp](https://imgur.com/a/tiaVZBE)

Great pair of closed back headphones. I am the third owner. Comes with the original box and almost all accessories. Accessories missing includes the stock pads (they were damaged) and the 1/8 to 1/4 adapter. To make up for it, it comes with a custom Impact Audio Cable with 1/4 connector and the Dekoni Limited Edition Pads for Stellia. No cosmetic marks I am aware of other than the normal discoloration of the headband, aka the Stellia Trait. Personally I like the discoloration but I did cover it with a headband cover to avoid further discoloration. 

Focal Clear - $950 - [Timestamp](https://imgur.com/a/4nGECuV)

Great pair of open back headphones with some saying the best in the Focal lineup (I have not tried the Utopia so I cannot confirm nor deny this). I am the third owner. Comes with the original box and all accessories. No cosmetic marks on the headband or pads so I would say they are in excellent, if not pristine condition. Also has a headband cover to protect it. 

Master &amp; Dynamic MW65 -$290 - [Timestamp](https://imgur.com/a/cfmjqwv)

Great pair of wireless Headphones and if I must say quite good looking. Unfortunately did not get to use these that much as they were meant to be my commuting headphones but due to Covid I have been working from home. They barely have been used so I would say they are in pristine condition. There is a tiny, tiny black mark on the right can. Comes with the original packaging and accessories. Has excellent noise cancellation and if you use google assistant it pairs amazingly well with it, but it does also pair with other voice assistants. It says it was made in collaboration with Kevin Durant but I believe they just slapped the name on it because there is no popping cosmetic feature I am aware of.

Surface Headphones v1 - $90 - [Timestamp](https://imgur.com/a/Pg1vYrz)

My wireless headphones prior to the MW65 and the reason I started to take care better of my headphones. Heavily used and has noticeable wear, such as peeling on the pads and the headband has loosened up. Other than that, they work well and has good noise cancellation. Pairs well with other surface products. Comes with the original box and accessories. 

Harmonicdyne Helios - $100 - [Timestamp](https://imgur.com/a/rf0uW7N)

A good pair of Open Back Headphones with V Shaped sound. The design on these are stunning which the primarily reason I got them, and sound amazing when listening to EDM. I am the second owner and they are in excellent condition with no cosmetic marks I am aware of. 

Schiit Jotunheim w/ AK4490 DAC - $390 - [Timestamp](https://imgur.com/a/tKoToOD)

This was my first Amp/Dac and it has served me well, but now I am looking to move to towards tube amps. Great entry level setup in my opinion. No cosmetic marks or dinks that I am aware of. I am the second owner. Comes with the original packaging but does not come with a USB cable.

Hey guys, looking to sell off some of my audio gear. All prices in USD &amp; will be invoiced in CAD. PLEASE READ THE TEXT FOR THE ZMF ATTICUS IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN BUYING THEM.  


So first off, I have a LTD Atticus in Camphor Burl (the only one available in fact) that I ordered during ZMF November that I'm looking to transfer ownership (basically you pay me what I paid, and I'll have ZMF send the headphones to you rather then me). They still have not shipped (but I believe they will be shipping very soon as the list for the orders is decreasing by the day.) Only going to have this offer up until they're ready to ship out the Atticus, so the sooner you PM me about it, the higher chance you have at getting the headphones. These are B-Stock (however they were apparently used as a showroom unit so I'd assume their actual condition would be closer to A-Stock.) Order includes some extra pads but I'm sure you can cancel them if you'd like once you get ownership. **$1350 USD (what I paid + Paypal Fees)**  


Secondly, I have a pair of modded ATH-AD2000's. They have the AD2000 drivers, but they were put inside of an ATH-AD700 chassis. Also modded to have a detachable cable. Example of mod [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/6ndg7d/audio_technica_athad700_mod_with_ad2000_drivers/) Looking to sell this for around **$360 USD** (what I paid for it). Comes with a headphone case and the custom cable (Toxic Cables copper with viablue connectors).   


Thirdly, looking to sell off my DAC + AMP combo (SMSL-SU8 V2 + Drop THX 789). Nothing wrong with them except neither of them have boxes (I'll ship them securely). **$420 USD.**

Let me know if you have  any questions. I have two WatchExchange feedbacks and one Hardwareswap  feedback, and can provide eBay feedback if needed.
